## [0.5.0] - 2024-02-28

 - Improve recognition accuracy for long text lines, at the cost of longer
   inference times, by increasing max image width after preprocessing
   [#32](https://github.com/robertknight/ocrs/pull/32)

 - Added `--text-line-images` option to save previews of text lines after
   preprocessing. This is useful for debugging recognition accuracy issues
   [#29](https://github.com/robertknight/ocrs/pull/29),
   [#30](https://github.com/robertknight/ocrs/pull/30).

 - Added a note in the README about the importance of building ocrs (or at least
   the rten dependencies) in release mode
   [#28](https://github.com/robertknight/ocrs/pull/28)

 - Updated rten to 0.4.0. This includes optimizations for post-processing of
   the text segmentation mask [#23](https://github.com/robertknight/ocrs/pull/23).

## [0.4.0] - 2024-01-23

 - Updated rten to v0.3.1. This improves performance on Arm by ~30%.

 - Fix panic in layout analysis when average word spacing in a line is negative
   [#20](https://github.com/robertknight/ocrs/pull/20)

 - Added LICENSE files to repository (Apache 2, MIT)
   [#12](https://github.com/robertknight/ocrs/pull/12)

## [0.3.1] - 2024-01-03

 - Fix cache directory location on Windows [#9](https://github.com/robertknight/ocrs/pull/9)

 - Improved speed on ARM by ~16% [9224ac9](https://github.com/robertknight/ocrs/commit/9224ac9)

## [0.3.0] - 2024-01-02

 - Extract the ocrs project out of the [RTen](https://github.com/robertknight/rten)
   repository and into a standalone repo at https://github.com/robertknight/ocrs.

 - Improve the `--json` output format with extracted text and coordinates of
   the rotated bounding rect for each word and line (92f17fb).

## [0.2.1] - 2024-01-01

 - Update rten to fix incorrect output on non-x64 / wasm32 platforms

## [0.2.0] - 2024-01-01

 - Improve layout analysis (ce52b3a1, cefb6c3f). The longer term plan is to use
   machine learning for layout analysis, but these incremental tweaks address
   some of the most egregious errors.
 - Add `--version` flag to CLI (20055ee0)
 - Revise CLI flags for specifying output format (97c3a011). The output path
   is now specified with `-o`. Available formats are text (default), JSON
   (`--json`) or annotated PNG (`--png`).
 - Fixed slow OCR model downloads by changing hosting location
   (https://github.com/robertknight/rten/issues/22).

## [0.1.0] - 2023-12-31

Initial release.
